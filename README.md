## Jackal

The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds them to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.\
Also if a Spy or Impostor gets sidekicked, they still will appear red to the Impostors.

The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostors left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and their Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its Sidekick.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game, the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.

# Extras
## New Colors!
New colors are added for crewmates to pick from.

## Custom Hats!
Custom hats have been added, made by some very talented artists. These are mostly hats for streamers.

We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\CustomHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.
